# VcMOSTRenderMqb
Way to write custom data to Virtual cockpit for MQB platform

To make this work you need to install Python3.3 to MIB2.5 first using following package repositories: https://pkgsrc.mibsolution.one then save current version of VCRenderData.py to sd card or upload it via winSCP
To run the code then execute 

> python3.3 /fs/sda0/VCRenderData.py

This is what can be achieved for now

Now font can be scaled and also some new characters/icons appeared

My next goal is to get some usefull data from exlap channel and render them in theory it should be possible to also get data/image from AA/CP and render them onto VC. Any help or ideas are appreciated.
